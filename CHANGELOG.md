## v1.1.1 - Purchase DPS with AVAX native token
- Added script to deploy Sale V5. It's based on Sale V4, which by the way removed the elligility constraint. The price is 0.75 USD.

## v1.1.0 - Purchase DPS with AVAX native token

- Using the new `Sale.purchaseDPSWithAVAX` method, investors can now use the native token to purchase the DeepSquare

- The `Sale.purchaseDPS` method has been renamed to `Sale.purchaseDPSWithSTC` to follow the nomenclature.

First open source publication of the DeepSquare Association smart contracts, deployed on the Avalanche C-Chain.
